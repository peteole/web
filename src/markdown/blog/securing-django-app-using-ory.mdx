Using Ory Cloud with Django Framework.

One can build a web application with Python programming language, and there are several
options for choosing a web framework. We have at least two frameworks such as Django or Flask.
[In the previous blog post](https://www.ory.sh/securing-flask-application-using-kratos-and-keto/),
we discussed how to secure a web application using Ory Kratos. Let's do the same thing for Django.

Django is a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines and can help build web
applications quickly. It has its authentication and permissions framework, admin
interface, and a lot of integrations with popular relational database systems such
as PostgreSQL, Percona Server, SQLite, MySQL, and MariaDB.

I love building web apps using Django because it was my first web framework, and I love its ecosystem.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple one-page application with authentication covered by Ory Cloud.

_Let's start hacking, huh?_

## Bootstrapping Django project

Django has many ways to bootstrap a project:

1. Django cookiecutter is a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django apps. It's a useful framework generating everything you need for the Django project, including docker support, integration with Cloud storage such as S3, and many more.
2. `django-admin` command. We'll use it because we want to build something simple, and it would be easier for local development.

It would be best if you had poetry installed because it's the primary tool for managing dependencies for this tutorial.

```bash
mkdir django-ory-cloud
cd django-ory-cloud
poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

Package name [django-ory-cloud]:
Version [0.1.0]:
Description []:  An example django application with Ory Cloud as an Authentication backend
Author [John Doe, n to skip]: John Doe
License []:
Compatible Python versions [^3.10]:

Would you like to define your main dependencies interactively? (yes/no) [yes] no
Would you like to define your development dependencies interactively? (yes/no) [yes] no
Generated file

[tool.poetry]
name = "django-ory-cloud"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An example django application with Ory Cloud as an Authentication backend"
authors = ["John Doe"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"


Do you confirm generation? (yes/no) [yes] yes
```

Installing Django

```bash
poetry add Django
Creating virtualenv django-ory-cloud-0UeuvAWs-py3.10 in /Users/gen1us2k/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs

  • Installing django (4.0.4)
```

Creating project

```bash
poetry run django-admin startproject mysite
```

It generates the following project structure and you can learn more about the structure
[here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project)

```bash
.
├── mysite
│   ├── manage.py
│   └── mysite
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── asgi.py
│       ├── settings.py
│       ├── urls.py
│       └── wsgi.py
├── poetry.lock
└── pyproject.toml

2 directories, 8 files

```

Now it's time to install additional dependencies such as
[`django-environ`](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to enable
configuration via environment variables and
[`django-ory-auth`](https://pypi.org/project/django-ory-auth/) to enable integration
with Ory Cloud

```bash
poetry add django-environ django-ory-auth
Using version ^0.8.1 for django-environ
Using version ^0.1.3 for django-ory-auth

  • Installing django-ory-auth (0.1.3)

poetry shell

```

## Enabling django-ory-auth package

On the previous step we installed `django-ory-auth` package.
We need to add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` by editing `mysite/settings.py` file.

```python
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'django_ory_auth',
]

```
Let's discuss the next steps of our integration. Django-ory-auth package comes with a
context processor and an authentication backend. Context processor provides additional
context such as login_url, logout_url, and many more to use in templates.
The authentication backend replaces the default Django authentication backends because we store identity data in the remote identity provider.

It works fine with `AUTH_USER_MODEL` and Django's permission framework. You can still use `is_staff` and `is_superuser` fields of the default user model.

Add this to the `mysite/settings.py` file:

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    "django_ory_auth.backend.OryBackend",
]
```

Django's default settings do not have an out-of-the-box configuration for templates,
so we need to make additional changes. This example uses `mysite/templates` folder
to store templates, and we need to make further changes.

Edit `mysite/settings.py` file

```python
# Add import os to the beginning of the file
import os
import environ

env = environ.Env()
...
# We need to change a couple of settings here
TEMPLATES
...
        # This tells django to use `mysite/templates` dir
        # for searching templates
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
                # Add this line to enable context processor
                # and have variables like `login_url` available
                # in templates
                'django_ory_auth.context.processor',
            ],
        },
...
```


## Setting up Ory Cloud

Okay. We need to have an Ory Cloud project and install ory cli
tool for the next steps. You can follow the following guides

1. [Creating a project](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/console/create-project)
2. [Installing cli](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/installation)

As a next step, you need to copy Ory Kratos URL. You can find it by opening `Connect` from the sidebar of the https://console.ory.sh.
The URL follows this pattern `https://projectid.project.oryapis.com`. On the other hand, we can use a playground project created for demo purposes.

Add it to the `mysite/settings.py`

```python
...
ORY_SDK_URL='https://playground.project.oryapis.com'
ORY_UI_URL='https://playground.project.oryapis.com/ui'
```

That's app for the preparation part.
